# Logistic Regression From Scratch

A minimal project that illustrates how logistic regression works behind the scenes.
Its purpose is educational — to build the core components of logistic regression manually, without relying on machine-learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

## 📌 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn and visualize how logistic regression works, including:

- implementing the model manually using NumPy

- performing gradient descent

- making predictions using the sigmoid function

- computing classification decision boundaries

- visualizing results on easy and hard datasets

## 🖼️ Visualization

 The script plots:

- data points for each class

- the learned decision boundary computed from the final weights
